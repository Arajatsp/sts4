# Spring CLI Extension

The extension integrates into Visual Studio Code UI [Spring CLI](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cli/reference/) which increases productivity when new Spring Boot projects are created or new functionality added to existing projects.

Easy way to add new functionality to Spring Boot projects from predefined projects registered with Spring CLI or from Gen AI by right-clikcing on the project's `pom.xml`

![Add-Functionality][Add-Functionality]

Easy access to the Gen AI generated Mardown file with an easy way to apply it:

![Gen-AI-Markdown][Gen-AI-markdown]

Applying the Gen AI response markdown guide to a project shows a diff view of what is about to happen to the project and can be undone via IDE provided "Undo" functionality

![Prewview-Changes][Preview-Changes]

Furthermore, managing Spring CLI projects, projects catalogs and user defined commands is nicely wrapped into VSCode quick-pick UI elements via commands.

## Requirements
**IMPORTANT** The extension requires Spring CLI to be installed on your system. See [Spring CLI Installation Guide](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cli/reference/installation.html). If Spring CLI executable is on the `PATH` environment variable then please use Spring CLI Extension setting `spring-cli.executable` to specify the path to Spring CLI executable file.
